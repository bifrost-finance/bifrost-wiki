# Bifrost Staking Tutorial

## Delegating and Staking <a href="#bifrost-staking-tutorial-delegate-to-collator" id="bifrost-staking-tutorial-delegate-to-collator"></a>

The following steps will guide any BNC holder to do Staking on Bifrost, delegate BNCs for Collators and receive Staking rewards. Learn more about the [Collator System and parameters](https://wiki.bifrost.finance/node/bifrost-collator-obt). (\*This tutorial was capturing under the testnet, ASG equals to Bifrost BNC on mainnet.)

**Step 1**: Make sure you have BNC (claim test-BNC on [Bifrost Faucet](https://t.me/bifrost\_faucet)), go to https://bifrost.app, switch to **Bifrost Stage Network** check all Collators.

**Active**: Active Collators, producing blocks and releasing Staking rewards. (The more stake a Collator has, the less reward the delegator gets, and vice versa)

**Waiting**: Collator candidates, no Staking rewards.&#x20;

_Tip: For each Collator, only top 100 delegators can receive Staking rewards, the ranking relates to delegating amount._
